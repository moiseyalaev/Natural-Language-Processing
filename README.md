# Natural-Language-Processing

Here I have 3 major types of NPL projects that I worked: Embeddings, LSTM/GRU models, text generation/prediction. Note that I learned these methods as I went and therefore other better approaches very likely exist with fewer potential errors. However, I believe that these models are relavetly robust for the problems I tackeled in each file. Below is the order from least complex to most complex models/problems:

1. NPL_Embeddings
2. LSTM_GRU_models
3. NPL_Predictions

Feel free to adjust hyper parameters to see how they effect the loss/accuracy! As always, thanks for taking an interest in my learning processs!
